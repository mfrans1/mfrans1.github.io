Teaching

### Tomlinson Teaching Assistant
While McGill University doesnâ€™t regularly allow undergraduate students to be teaching assistants, exceptional students may be awarded the merit-based Tomlinson Engagement Award for mentoring. I was honored to have received this award, allowing me to be a teaching assistant for the introductory [ATOC214: Introduction to Physics of the Atmosphere](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/atoc-214) course. In addition to the outlined requirements of being a TA (writing exam/homework questions, grading, and hosting tutorials), I wanted to really engage with the students and give a guest lecture. I developed a simple 1D climate model, which I distributed to students. This model had tunable features which allowed students to emulate: Earth with/without an atmosphere, the climate of Mars, and a climate with changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. I used this model to host an interactive guest lecture, taking about 30 minutes. The lecture explored principles of radiative balance, the greenhouse gas effect, climate equilibria as well as some fun hypothetical questions (how much CO2 to make Mars warm like Earth). The model was also a component of homework assignments handed to students.

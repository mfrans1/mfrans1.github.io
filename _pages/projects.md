This is a collection of personal and volunteer projects that Iâ€™ve completed outside of formal research settings. Unlike the work featured in the Research section, these projects were not supervised or funded, nor were they conducted for academic credit. Instead, they reflect my own curiosity and drive to apply and expand my skills in data science through self-directed challenges and hands-on learning.

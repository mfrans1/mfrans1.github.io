During my time at the Mount Washington Observatory, I had to opportunity engage with numer science outreach and communication opportunities. I gained experience in radio broadcasting with [WDEV Radio Vermont](https://wdevradio.com/) as well as [New Hampshire Public Radio](https://www.nhpr.org/), releasing 48-hour state wide weather forecasts for both Vermont and New Hampshire. I also got the opportunity to present at MWOBS Science in the Mountains, a year-round free web-based lecture series (linked above). I, along with my colleague intern, presented our project: A climatology of Solid-to-Liquid Ratio on the Summit of Mount Washington (1980-2024).

## McGill Student Council - Vice President and DEI Officer
I was the Vice-President and DEI Officer of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Society of Undergraduates at McGill student council (AOSSUM). Ensuring the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department continued to be an exemplary environment for diversity and inclusion. Was responsible for guaranteeing the accessibility needs for all students in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences are being met; coordinated with McGillâ€™s Student Accessibility and Achievement Office (formerly Office for Students with Disabilities). Beyond the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, the DEI officer also reviews and participates in the Science Undergraduate Society equity training days, maintaining and enforcing the EDI standard throughout all McGill Undergraduate Societies. This experience highlights my contributions to giving back to the community.

## aCADemy - Co-Founder and Vice President
Co-founded a web-based education service for learning Computer Aided Design called [McGill aCADemy](https://mcgillacademy.wixsite.com/website), with a group of highly passionate undergraduate engineering students. As VP Internal I developed the core curriculum and developed most of the tutorials. The goal of aCADemy was to introduce the CAD software SolidWorks to students in highschool and early undergraduate programs. Tutorials were developed as a series, going from the most basic introduction to designing drones. aCADemy would provide students with enough experience to pursue passion projects and extracurricular design teams. McGill aCADemy was supported by the McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society. This experience demonstrates my profound and long-standing interest in teaching and community-outreach.

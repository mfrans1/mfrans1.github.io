# I'm Mees, an environmental data scientist

<div style="text-align: left;">
I love bringing together data science and climate. This website showcases some of my research, projects, or anything else I want to share with the world. Whether its field work, machine learning, or high-performance computing; I love it all. Enjoy looking around the website and what I have been up to.

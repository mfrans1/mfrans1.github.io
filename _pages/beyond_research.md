## McGill Student Council 2021-2023
I was the Vice-President and Equity Diversity and Inclusion Officer of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Society of Undergraduates at McGill student council (AOSSUM). Ensuring the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department continued to be an exemplary environment for diversity and inclusion. Was responsible for guaranteeing the accessibility needs for all students in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences are being met; coordinated with McGillâ€™s Student Accessibility and Achievement Office (formerly Office for Students with Disabilities). Beyond the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, the EDI officer also reviews and participates in the Science Undergraduate Society equity training days, maintaining and enforcing the EDI standard throughout all McGill Undergraduate Societies. This experience highlights my contributions to giving back to the community.

## aCADemy, learning computer aided design
Co-founded a web-based education service for learning Computer Aided Design called [McGill aCADemy](https://mcgillacademy.wixsite.com/website), with a group of highly passionate undergraduate engineering students. As VP Internal I developed the core curriculum and developed most of the tutorials. The goal of aCADemy was to introduce the CAD software SolidWorks to students in highschool and early undergraduate programs. Tutorials were developed as a series, going from the most basic introduction to designing drones. aCADemy would provide students with enough experience to pursue passion projects and extracurricular design teams. McGill aCADemy was supported by the McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society. This experience demonstrates my profound and long-standing interest in teaching and community-outreach.

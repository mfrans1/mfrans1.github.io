Teaching
======

### Tomlinson Teaching Assistant
I was the undergraduate TA for [ATOC214: Introduction to Physics of the Atmosphere](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/atoc-214). Aside from regular TA duties, I also developed a simple 1D climate model, which I distributed to students. This model had features which allowed students to emulate: Earth with/without an atmosphere, the climate of Mars, and changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. I used this model to host an interactive guest lecture.
